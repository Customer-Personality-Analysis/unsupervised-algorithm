## Customer Personality Analisys
### Description
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

### Exercise
It is necessary to know the purchasing power of each client and who are the ones who spend the most on wines in such a way that the wine advertising campaign can be segmented and focused exclusively on these clients.

### Algorithm
Algorithms use in this project are:

    - K-means clustering (kmeans)
    - Hierarchical Clustering (hclust)
